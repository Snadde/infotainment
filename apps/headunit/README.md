The head unit application is also an Android application which has a WebView in which it displays and hosts the web application that is received from the primary device.

You need a web server running on the android device that is running this application. We use (kWS)[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xeustechnologies.android.kws&hl=en]
